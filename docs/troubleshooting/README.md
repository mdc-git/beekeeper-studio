## SQLite

### I get 'permission denied' when trying to access a database on an external drive

If you're on Linux and using the `snap` version of Beekeeper you need to give the app an extra permission.

```bash
sudo snap connect beekeeper-studio:removable-media :removable-media
```

If you're on another platform, please [open a ticket][bug] and we'll try to help you debug the problem.
